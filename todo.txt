OoLME To Do List:

- Finish adding simulation/analysis/output control framework
-- Create Network Exploration mode
-- Create Reaction Network Output
-- Heredity Analysis
-- Packard Plot Analysis
-- Autocatalysis detection
-- Transition matrix Output

- Make sure buffer/non-buffer works correctly

- Add language for describing energies of compounds, allow Boltzmann
factor in reactions

- Add ability to link together multiple zones 
- Add ability to define transport between zones

- Add ability to use external functions for various things (via dlopen)

- Speed test algorithm, possibly use alternative methods automatically when the
situation calls for it.

- 'Boundary' section - do we need this, how should it work?
- Add ability to perturb the simulation mid-run
