OoLME To Do List:

X Finish adding simulation/analysis/output control framework
	X Create Network Exploration mode
	X Create Reaction Network Output
	Heredity Analysis
	Packard Plot Analysis
	Autocatalysis detection
	Transition matrix Output

- Allow assigning compounds 'energy' or other derived quantities, with the possibility of using them in an equation for the reaction rates or other things
-- Need some kind of built-in scripting language to allow these equations to be user-defined

- Make sure isReversed modifier is applied correctly in applyRule

- Make sure buffer/non-buffer works correctly

- Add language for describing energies of compounds, allow Boltzmann
factor in reactions

- Add ability to link together multiple zones 
- Add ability to define transport between zones

- Add ability to use external functions for various things (via dlopen)

- Speed test algorithm, possibly use alternative methods automatically when the
situation calls for it.

- 'Boundary' section - do we need this, how should it work?
- Add ability to perturb the simulation mid-run

- Triplet and higher order reactions
- Generalize rules for population-based reaction weighting
